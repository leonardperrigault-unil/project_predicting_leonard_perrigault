# **Title:** *Predicting and Classifying Life Expectancy Using Socioeconomic, Health, and Environmental Indicators*  


## **Problem Statement / Motivation**  
Life expectancy represents one of the most comprehensive indicators of a country's well-being, combining the effects of health systems, economic development, education, and environmental factors. Understanding and predicting life expectancy is crucial for policymakers and researchers seeking to improve global living conditions.  

This project aims to explore two complementary approaches:  
1. **Regression modeling** – to predict the exact life expectancy value of each country.  
2. **Classification modeling** – to categorize countries into life expectancy levels (*Low*, *Medium*, *High*).  

By combining these two perspectives, the project not only provides quantitative predictions but also enables an interpretable categorization of global life expectancy patterns.


## **Planned Approach and Technologies**  
The dataset used will be the **“Global Country Information Dataset 2023”** from **Kaggle**, containing detailed socioeconomic, environmental, and health indicators for countries worldwide.  

The project will be developed in **Python**, using **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Scikit-learn**.  

### **Part 1 – Regression Approach**  
- **Goal:** Predict the numerical value of life expectancy.  
- **Models:** Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor.  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** R², MAE, RMSE.  
- **Visualization:** Actual vs. predicted plots, feature importance ranking, and regression residuals.  

### **Part 2 – Classification Approach**  
- **Goal:** Classify countries into life expectancy categories (e.g., *Low <65*, *Medium 65–75*, *High >75*).  
- **Models:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM).  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix.  
- **Visualization:** Class distribution plots and regional classification maps.  


## **Expected Challenges and How They Will Be Addressed**  
- **Data Quality and Missing Values:** Addressed through imputation and normalization.   
- **Class Imbalance (for classification):** Resampling techniques such as SMOTE or class weighting will be applied.  
- **Overfitting:** Controlled using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.  


## **Success Criteria**  
The project will be considered successful if:  
- Regression models achieve strong predictive accuracy (R² > 0.85).  
- Classification models demonstrate reliable performance (accuracy > 80%).  
- Visualizations clearly illustrate both numerical predictions and categorical trends across countries.  


## **Stretch Goals (if time permits)**  
- Integration of **ensemble learning techniques** (XGBoost, Gradient Boosting).  
- Development of an **interactive Streamlit dashboard** for model comparison.  
- **Geospatial visualization** using **Plotly** or **GeoPandas** to map global life expectancy patterns.
